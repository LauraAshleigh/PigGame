# PigGame
A dice game of pig that I coded during a Udemy course on JavaScript.
Open index.html in browser to play.
NB: I followed a tutorial to code the JavaScript for this game. The HTML and CSS was provided.

GAME RULES:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls 2 dice as many times as they wish. Each result gets added to their ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all their ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that their ROUND score gets added to their TOTAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- If a player rolls a double 6, they lose their TOTAL score
- The first player to reach 100 points (or other desired final score) on TOTAL score wins the game
